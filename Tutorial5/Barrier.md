- Only able to cross a barrier if ALL are ready

# Cellular Automata
[Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

- Elements must be updated iteration by iteration
- All elements must be updated in iteration N before processing N+1

"Until **all shows up**, and then weâ€™ll start preparing meals"
### Solution
1. Make N "receipts"
2. When one comes, takes a receipt. Is it the last receipt?
- YES: Tells people that all shows up
- NO: Sits and waits for others.

        Barrier barrier = new Barrier(4);
        Thread a = new Thread(new Participant("A", 0, 1000, barrier));
        Thread b = new Thread(new Participant("B", 2000, 2000, barrier));
        Thread c = new Thread(new Participant("C", 1000, 2000, barrier));

# JDK CyclicBarrier
java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier

`await()`: Waits until all parties have invoked await on this barrier.

# Barrier using Semaphore
1. Make a semaphore with count = 0. No one is allowed to cross
2. When one comes, takes a receipt. If the last receipt signals the semaphore
3. Acquire semaphore and release immediately

[Page 29(41) - The little book of semaphore](http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/downey08semaphores.pdf)

```java
public class SemaphoreBarrier {
    private int receipts;
    private Semaphore sem;
    public Barrier(int parties) {
        this.receipts = parties;
        sem = new Semaphore(0); //No one allow to cross
    }
    public synchronized void await() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized(this) {
            --receipts; //Take receipts
            if(receipt == 0)
                sem.signal();
        }
        sem.wait();
        sem.signal();
    }
}
```
